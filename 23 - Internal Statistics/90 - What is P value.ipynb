        "# What is P-value?\n",
        "\n",
        "The **P-value** (Probability value) is a fundamental concept in hypothesis testing. It quantifies the strength of the evidence against the Null Hypothesis ($H_0$).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Definition\n",
        "The P-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is correct.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Interpretation\n",
        "*   **Low P-value ($\\le 0.05$):** Strong evidence against the null hypothesis. We reject $H_0$.\n",
        "    *   \"The observed result is very unlikely to have happened by random chance if $H_0$ were true.\"\n",
        "*   **High P-value ($> 0.05$):** Weak evidence against the null hypothesis. We fail to reject $H_0$.\n",
        "    *   \"The observed result could easily have happened by random chance even if $H_0$ were true.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "## Visualizing P-value\n",
        "Imagine a normal distribution representing the null hypothesis. The P-value is the area under the tail(s) of the curve beyond our observed test statistic.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **One-tailed test:** Area in one tail (left or right).\n",
        "*   **Two-tailed test:** Sum of areas in both tails.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Common Misconceptions\n",
        "*   The P-value is **NOT** the probability that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
        "*   The P-value is **NOT** the probability that the alternative hypothesis is false.\n",
        "*   It only tells us how weird our data is assuming the null hypothesis is true."
