        "# Hypothesis Testing and Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate a hypothesis about a population parameter. It provides a structured way to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Mechanism\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Formulate Hypotheses:**\n",
        "    *   **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The default assumption. It usually states that there is *no effect*, *no difference*, or *no relationship*. We assume this is true until proven otherwise.\n",
        "    *   **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$ or $H_a$):** The claim we want to test for. It states that there *is* an effect, difference, or relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Select Significance Level ($\\alpha$):**\n",
        "    *   The threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis. Common values are 0.05 (5%), 0.01 (1%), or 0.10 (10%).\n",
        "    *   If $\\alpha = 0.05$, we accept a 5% chance of rejecting $H_0$ when it is actually true.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Collect Data and Calculate Test Statistic:**\n",
        "    *   Calculate a value (like Z-score, t-score, F-score) from the sample data that measures how far the sample result is from what is expected under $H_0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Determine the P-value or Critical Value:**\n",
        "    *   **P-value:** The probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as, or more extreme than, the one observed, assuming $H_0$ is true.\n",
        "    *   **Critical Region:** The range of values for the test statistic that leads to rejection of $H_0$.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Make a Decision:**\n",
        "    *   **If P-value $\\le \\alpha$:** Reject $H_0$. (The result is statistically significant).\n",
        "    *   **If P-value $> \\alpha$:** Fail to reject $H_0$. (There is not enough evidence to support $H_1$).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Example Scenario\n",
        "*   **Claim:** A drug reduces recovery time.\n",
        "*   **$H_0$:** The drug has no effect on recovery time.\n",
        "*   **$H_1$:** The drug reduces recovery time.\n",
        "*   We run a trial. If the recovery time is significantly lower in the drug group compared to the placebo group (low p-value), we reject $H_0$ and conclude the drug works."
