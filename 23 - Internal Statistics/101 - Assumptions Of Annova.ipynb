        "# Assumptions of ANOVA\n",
        "\n",
        "For the results of an ANOVA test to be valid, certain assumptions must be met.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. Normality\n",
        "*   The dependent variable should be approximately normally distributed for each category of the independent variable.\n",
        "*   **Check:** Shapiro-Wilk test or Q-Q plots.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. Homogeneity of Variance (Homoscedasticity)\n",
        "*   The variances of the different groups should be equal.\n",
        "*   **Check:** Levene's test or Bartlett's test.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 3. Independence\n",
        "*   The observations in each group are independent of each other and the observations in other groups.\n",
        "*   **Check:** Study design (Random sampling).\n",
        "\n",
        "## What if assumptions are violated?\n",
        "*   **Normality:** ANOVA is robust to moderate violations if sample sizes are equal. If severe, use Kruskal-Wallis H Test (Non-parametric).\n",
        "*   **Homogeneity:** Use Welch's ANOVA."
