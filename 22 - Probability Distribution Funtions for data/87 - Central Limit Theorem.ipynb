        "# Central Limit Theorem (CLT)\n",
        "\n",
        "The Central Limit Theorem is one of the most important theorems in statistics. It states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean will approach a **Normal Distribution** as the sample size gets larger, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Points\n",
        "*   **Population Distribution:** Can be anything (Uniform, Exponential, Binomial, etc.).\n",
        "*   **Sample Size (n):** Needs to be sufficiently large (usually $n \\ge 30$ is considered a rule of thumb).\n",
        "*   **Result:** The distribution of sample means ($\\bar{X}$) will be approximately Normal with:\n",
        "    *   Mean $\\mu_{\\bar{x}} = \\mu$ (Population Mean)\n",
        "    *   Standard Deviation $\\sigma_{\\bar{x}} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}$ (Standard Error)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why is it important?\n",
        "It allows us to use statistical methods that assume normality (like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals) even when the underlying data is not normally distributed, provided we have a large enough sample."
