    "## 12. Summary <a id='summary'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Opening Files:**\n",
    "   - Use `open(filename, mode)` to open files\n",
    "   - Always close files after use or use `with` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **File Modes:**\n",
    "   - `'r'`: Read (default)\n",
    "   - `'w'`: Write (overwrites)\n",
    "   - `'a'`: Append\n",
    "   - `'r+'`, `'w+'`, `'a+'`: Read and write combinations\n",
    "   - Add `'b'` for binary mode\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reading Methods:**\n",
    "   - `read()`: Read entire file or specified bytes\n",
    "   - `readline()`: Read single line\n",
    "   - `readlines()`: Read all lines as list\n",
    "   - Iterate over file object: Most memory-efficient\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Writing Methods:**\n",
    "   - `write(string)`: Write string to file\n",
    "   - `writelines(list)`: Write list of strings\n",
    "   - Remember to add `\\n` for newlines\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Context Manager (`with` statement):**\n",
    "   - Automatically handles file closing\n",
    "   - Ensures proper resource management\n",
    "   - Handles exceptions gracefully\n",
    "   - **Always preferred over manual open/close**\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **File Positioning:**\n",
    "   - `tell()`: Get current position\n",
    "   - `seek(offset)`: Move to specific position\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Binary Files:**\n",
    "   - Use 'b' mode for non-text files\n",
    "   - Data handled as bytes\n",
    "   - No encoding/decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Best Practices:**\n",
    "   - Always use `with` statement\n",
    "   - Specify encoding for text files\n",
    "   - Handle exceptions appropriately\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate read method for file size\n",
    "   - Don't load large files entirely into memory\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Reading a file\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    content = f.read()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'w') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('Hello, World!')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Appending to a file\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'a') as f:\n",
    "    f.write('\\nNew line')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Processing line by line\n",
    "with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n",
    "    for line in f:\n",
    "        process(line)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copying files\n",
    "with open('source.txt', 'r') as src, open('dest.txt', 'w') as dst:\n",
    "    dst.write(src.read())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Remember:\n",
    "- Files are a fundamental way to persist data\n",
    "- Proper file handling prevents data loss and resource leaks\n",
    "- Always consider encoding for text files\n",
    "- Use appropriate modes for your needs\n",
    "- Exception handling is crucial for robust file operations"
