        "# What are Random Variables?\n",
        "\n",
        "A **Random Variable** is a variable whose value is determined by the outcome of a random phenomenon or experiment. It assigns a numerical value to each outcome of a random process.\n",

        "## Types of Random Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1. Discrete Random Variable\n",
        "*   Takes on a countable number of distinct values.\n",
        "*   **Examples:**\n",
        "    *   Number of heads when flipping a coin 3 times (0, 1, 2, 3)\n",
        "    *   Number of students absent in a class\n",
        "    *   Number of cars passing through a toll booth in an hour\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2. Continuous Random Variable\n",
        "*   Can take on any value within a range (infinitely many values).\n",
        "*   **Examples:**\n",
        "    *   Height of students in a class (e.g., 165.5 cm, 170.23 cm)\n",
        "    *   Temperature on a given day\n",
        "    *   Time taken to complete a task\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notation\n",
        "*   Random variables are typically denoted by capital letters: $X$, $Y$, $Z$.\n",
        "*   Specific values of a random variable are denoted by lowercase: $x$, $y$, $z$.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why are they important?\n",
        "Random variables form the foundation of probability distributions, which are essential for statistical inference, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling in data science."
