    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of \"objects\" which contain both data (attributes) and code (methods). OOP helps organize complex programs by grouping related data and functionality together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key OOP Principles:**\n",
    "- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data and methods that work on that data within one unit (class)\n",
    "- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and showing only essential features\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes from existing ones\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Using a single interface to represent different types\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why use OOP?**\n",
    "- Makes code more organized and maintainable\n",
    "- Promotes code reusability\n",
    "- Models real-world entities naturally\n",
    "- Makes debugging easier by isolating problems"

    "A **class** is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior that the objects created from it will have. Think of a class as a cookie cutter and objects as the cookies made from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Class Components:**\n",
    "- **Attributes:** Variables that store data (also called properties or fields)\n",
    "- **Methods:** Functions that define behavior (actions the object can perform)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "```python\n",

    "## 13. Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Classes and Objects:**\n",
    "   - A class is a blueprint for creating objects\n",
    "   - Objects are instances of classes with their own data\n",
    "   - Use classes to organize code and model real-world entities\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The `__init__` Method:**\n",
    "   - Constructor automatically called when creating objects\n",
    "   - Used to initialize instance variables\n",
    "   - Can accept parameters for customization\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **The `self` Parameter:**\n",
    "   - Refers to the current instance of the class\n",
    "   - Must be the first parameter of instance methods\n",
    "   - Used to access instance variables and methods\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Variables:**\n",
    "   - **Instance variables:** Unique to each object (`self.variable`)\n",
    "   - **Class variables:** Shared among all objects (defined in class body)\n",
    "   - Choose based on whether data should be shared or unique\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Methods:**\n",
    "   - **Instance methods:** Work with instance data (use `self`)\n",
    "   - **Class methods:** Work with class data (use `@classmethod` and `cls`)\n",
    "   - **Static methods:** Utility functions (use `@staticmethod`, no `self` or `cls`)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Special Methods:**\n",
    "   - Allow customization of built-in Python behavior\n",
    "   - Common ones: `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`, `__add__`, `__eq__`\n",
    "   - Make objects behave more naturally with Python operators\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Public: Accessible from anywhere (no prefix)\n",
    "   - Protected: Use only in class and subclasses (single underscore `_`)\n",
    "   - Private: Use only within class (double underscore `__`)\n",
    "   - Use `@property` decorator for controlled attribute access\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Naming Conventions:**\n",
    "   - Class names: PascalCase (e.g., `BankAccount`, `ShoppingCart`)\n",
    "   - Method/variable names: snake_case (e.g., `get_balance`, `account_number`)\n",
    "   - Private attributes: Double underscore prefix (e.g., `__pin`)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Documentation:**\n",
    "   - Write docstrings for classes and methods\n",
    "   - Explain what the class represents and what methods do\n",
    "   - Include parameter and return value descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Initialization:**\n",
    "   - Initialize all instance variables in `__init__`\n",
    "   - Provide default values when appropriate\n",
    "   - Validate parameters if necessary\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation:**\n",
    "   - Keep implementation details private\n",
    "   - Provide public methods for necessary operations\n",
    "   - Use properties for controlled attribute access\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Single Responsibility:**\n",
    "   - Each class should have one clear purpose\n",
    "   - Keep classes focused and cohesive\n",
    "   - Split complex classes into smaller ones\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Method Design:**\n",
    "   - Keep methods short and focused\n",
    "   - Use instance methods for operations on instance data\n",
    "   - Use class methods for factory patterns or class-level operations\n",
    "   - Use static methods for utilities that don't need instance or class data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Basic class structure\n",
    "class MyClass:\n",
    "    # Class variable\n",
    "    class_var = \"shared\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __init__(self, param1, param2):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Initialize the object.\"\"\"\n",
    "        # Instance variables\n",
    "        self.param1 = param1\n",
    "        self.param2 = param2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def instance_method(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Instance method.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return self.param1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @classmethod\n",
    "    def class_method(cls):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Class method.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return cls.class_var\n",
    "    \n",
    "    @staticmethod\n",
    "    def static_method(arg):\n",
    "        \"\"\"Static method.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return arg * 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        \"\"\"String representation.\"\"\"\n",
    "        return f\"MyClass({self.param1}, {self.param2})\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you understand classes and objects, you can explore:\n",
    "- **Inheritance:** Creating classes based on existing ones\n",
    "- **Polymorphism:** Using a common interface for different types\n",
    "- **Composition:** Building complex objects from simpler ones\n",
    "- **Abstract Base Classes:** Defining interfaces and abstract methods\n",
    "- **Dataclasses:** Simplified class creation for data storage\n",
    "- **Design Patterns:** Common solutions to recurring problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes and objects are fundamental to object-oriented programming in Python. Practice by creating classes that model real-world entities and solve actual problems in your projects!"
