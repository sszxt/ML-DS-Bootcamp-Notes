        "4. **submit()**: Submit individual tasks, returns Future\n",
        "5. **map()**: Like built-in map, returns results in order\n",
        "6. **as_completed()**: Process results as they finish\n",

        "|--------|----------|---------|-------|\n",
        "| submit() | Individual tasks | Future | Any |\n",
        "| map() | Same function, different inputs | Iterator | Preserved |\n",
        "| as_completed() | Process as ready | Iterator | Completion order |\n",
        "\n",
        "**Benefits:**\n",
        "- Simpler API than raw threading/multiprocessing\n",
        "- Automatic resource management with context managers\n",
        "- Exception handling built-in\n",
        "- Future objects for flexible result handling\n",
